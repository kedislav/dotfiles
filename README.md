## General Info
This rice was posted on January 18th, 2023 to [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn). Post can be [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/10fd5bt/sway_waybar_90s_scifi_anime_medley). It was inspired by general cyberpunk media, especially movies like *Akira*, *Ghost in the Shell* and *Patlabor*, as well as shows such as *Altered Carbon* and *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*.

### Extras
The font used everywhere is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), and for the icons to work you need the following fonts;
`ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-2048-em`, `ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-common`, `ttf-ubuntu-font-family` and `otf-font-awesome`. The [wallpaper](https://wallhaven.cc/w/g7jo5q) that is shown in the screenshots can be found here. The widget for the connection is **not nm-applet**. I am using `connman` in this install, so you will have to update the `on-click` behaviour in the waybar configuration to use your preferred connection manager.
